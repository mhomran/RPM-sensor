## telemetry system for vehicles
This system is made to measure the speed of a wheel of a vehicle and the RPM of its engine. Then, it sends the values to an Android using bluetooth module *HC-05*. Finally, the Android sends the value to a *firebase* database. The Controller is *Atmega2560* since it has more than one input capture unit peripheral.
