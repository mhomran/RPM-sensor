## telemetry system for vehicles
This system is made to measure the speed of a wheel of a vehicle and the RPM of its engine. Then, it sends the values to an Android using bluetooth module *HC-05*. Finally, the Android sends the value to a *firebase* database. The Controller is *Atmega2560* since it has more than one input capture unit peripheral. 

## Arduino nano version:-
### Components:-
- 10 Kohm resistor
- 104 code ceramic capacitor
- Arduino Nano
- 7414 HEX schmitt trigger IC

This version is used to measure the RPM of an engine in an international competition (shell eco marathon asia 2019). The project worked correctly during the whole competition.
